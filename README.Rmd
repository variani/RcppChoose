<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

RcppChoose is an example of project that combines two parts, 
C++ code ([libChoose/](libChoose/) and R package [rpackage/](rpackage/).

## Installation


```{r load}
devtools::load_all("rpackage/")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to choose `k` out of `n` numbers.

```{r example}
library(RcppChoose)

# choose: base R vs. RcppChoose implementation
choose(40, 20)
rcpp_choose(40, 20)

# 100 samples of sets of size k = 500 out of n = 1000
rcpp_nchoosek_sample(1000, 500, 100)
```
